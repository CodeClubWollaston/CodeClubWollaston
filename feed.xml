&lt;p&gt;We had our first session of November today. The group has now been split roughly into different teams to focus on the different challenges. Hopefully this should mean that we can share resources and tackle problems efficiently. Haydn is already working on the line sensor, and Nathanael is set to get 3D-printing so our robot can have a chassis. Harry and Iwan are both working on the Slightly Deranged Golf problem, and Lilly and Ollie are sorting the Duck Shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These names may be unfamiliar. In that case head on over to the Introducing page. There you can find introductions written by members of the team. It’s a bit sparse at the moment, with introductions from Harry, Iwan, and myself. More should be coming shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now that is all, but soon our sub-teams should start writing updates about their projects, which should flesh out this site a little.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Drage</name></author><summary type="html">Well, last half-term was busy, but this half-term should be busier.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The site is up!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/update/2017/10/11/the-site-is-up.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The site is up!" /><published>2017-10-11T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-10-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/update/2017/10/11/the-site-is-up</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/update/2017/10/11/the-site-is-up.html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Wollaston School Code Club’s new blog for the PiWars 2018 competition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be a little bare at the moment, but we hope to fill it with glorious content very soon, as well as frequently update it as we build our robot: The W.A.S.P. The “Wollaston’s Annoying Sound Producer” is the follow-up to our previous entry “Whoop-Whoop!”, who glided smoothly into 16th place. We have learned from last year, and we aim to do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to do more than just text content, with videos and images from the team being a possibility, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Drage</name></author><summary type="html">Welcome to Wollaston School Code Club’s new blog for the PiWars 2018 competition!</summary></entry></feed>
