He 3D printed the tracks and the wheels and the base of the robot. Natasha (me) doing the blog and helping with code and building. Sam Drage helped with buying stuff for the robot and coding and checking if everything works. Sam Young did coding and taking some of the responsibility from Sam Drage. Nathanael is in Year 11 and I am in Year 10 Sam Drage is in Year 13 Sam young is in Year 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were hoping to be closer to finishing with the robot than we are at this point in time. We were working on the code for distance sensor. Nathanael is working on the chassis for the robot, which should be finished this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/robot_currently.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;The robot in its current (temporary) state&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had a visitor, David Pride, who told us what to use and what not to use. He gave us a controller to use for controlling the robot. He gave us advice on automatic navigation and suggestions on building materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Natasha Duff</name></author><summary type="html">Nathanael is doing the 3D printing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/original_vs_cut.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Original bars and cut pins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re using a tank-like design for our robot, which involves creating caterpillar tracks to allow it to move. This is after Whoop-Whoop! suffered from a lack of grip last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sawing_pins_n2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Sawing pins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This involves cutting down 330mm by 2mm metal bars into smaller, 35mm by 2mm pins. Nothing a little sawing can’t handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pin_in_track.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;A pin inside a track&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each pin should fit snuggly inside each track, acting as a connector between each pair of tracks. It’s not a difficult task, there are just a lot of pins: 52 in total!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Drage</name></author><summary type="html">We’ve begun putting together the robot!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introducing</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/update/2017/11/01/introducing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing" /><published>2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/update/2017/11/01/introducing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/update/2017/11/01/introducing.html">&lt;p&gt;Well, last half-term was busy, but this half-term should be busier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had our first session of November today. The group has now been split roughly into different teams to focus on the different challenges. Hopefully this should mean that we can share resources and tackle problems efficiently. Haydn is already working on the line sensor, and Nathanael is set to get 3D-printing so our robot can have a chassis. Harry and Iwan are both working on the Slightly Deranged Golf problem, and Lilly and Ollie are sorting the Duck Shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These names may be unfamiliar. In that case head on over to the Introducing page. There you can find introductions written by members of the team. It’s a bit sparse at the moment, with introductions from Harry, Iwan, and myself. More should be coming shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now that is all, but soon our sub-teams should start writing updates about their projects, which should flesh out this site a little.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Drage</name></author><summary type="html">Well, last half-term was busy, but this half-term should be busier.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The site is up!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/update/2017/10/11/the-site-is-up.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The site is up!" /><published>2017-10-11T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-10-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/update/2017/10/11/the-site-is-up</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/update/2017/10/11/the-site-is-up.html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Wollaston School Code Club’s new blog for the PiWars 2018 competition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be a little bare at the moment, but we hope to fill it with glorious content very soon, as well as frequently update it as we build our robot: The W.A.S.P. The “Wollaston’s Annoying Sound Producer” is the follow-up to our previous entry “Whoop-Whoop!”, who glided smoothly into 16th place. We have learned from last year, and we aim to do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to do more than just text content, with videos and images from the team being a possibility, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Drage</name></author><summary type="html">Welcome to Wollaston School Code Club’s new blog for the PiWars 2018 competition!</summary></entry></feed>
